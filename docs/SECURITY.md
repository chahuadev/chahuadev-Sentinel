# Security Policy

**Comprehensive Security Guidelines for Chahuadev Sentinel**

## Overview

Security is a fundamental priority for Chahuadev Sentinel. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and guidelines for maintaining the highest levels of security throughout the project.

## Security Philosophy

### Core Security Principles

**Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of security controls and validation
- No single point of failure in security architecture
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits and assessments

**Least Privilege Access**
- Minimal required permissions for all operations
- Restricted file system access with explicit whitelisting
- Limited network access and external dependencies
- Controlled resource allocation and usage monitoring

**Secure by Design**
- Security considerations integrated from initial design
- Threat modeling for all major features and components
- Regular security review of architectural decisions
- Proactive security measures rather than reactive fixes

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

**Code Injection Attacks**
- Malicious code execution through user input
- AST manipulation and parser exploitation
- Configuration file manipulation
- Command injection through CLI parameters

**File System Attacks**
- Directory traversal and path manipulation
- Unauthorized file access and modification
- Symlink attacks and race conditions
- Resource exhaustion through large file processing

**Supply Chain Attacks**
- Malicious dependencies and packages
- Compromised development tools and build processes
- Man-in-the-middle attacks during updates
- Social engineering targeting maintainers

### Risk Assessment

**Critical Risks**
- Remote code execution through validation engine
- Unauthorized access to sensitive project files
- Data exfiltration through security middleware
- Service disruption through resource exhaustion

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Sandboxed execution environments for code analysis
- Strict file access controls and path validation
- Resource limits and monitoring for all operations

## Security Implementation

### Input Validation

**File Path Validation**
```javascript
// Example: Secure path validation
function validateFilePath(inputPath) {
    // Normalize path to prevent traversal attacks
    const normalizedPath = path.normalize(inputPath);
    
    // Ensure path is within allowed directories
    const allowedDirectories = ['/project', '/src', '/test'];
    const isAllowed = allowedDirectories.some(dir => 
        normalizedPath.startsWith(dir)
    );
    
    if (!isAllowed) {
        throw new SecurityError('Path not in allowed directory');
    }
    
    return normalizedPath;
}
```

**Code Content Validation**
- AST parsing with strict error handling
- Content size limits and timeout controls
- Malicious pattern detection and blocking
- Safe execution contexts for code analysis

### Access Control

**File System Permissions**
- Read-only access to source files
- Restricted write access to configuration directories
- No access to system files or sensitive directories
- Explicit whitelisting of allowed file patterns

**Network Security**
- No outbound network connections during validation
- Local-only operation for all core functionality
- Secure update mechanisms with signature validation
- Restricted access to external resources and APIs

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Information Handling**
- No storage of sensitive data in logs or temporary files
- Memory cleanup after processing sensitive content
- Encrypted communication for any network operations
- Secure disposal of temporary files and data

**Privacy Protection**
- No collection of personal or proprietary information
- Local-only processing without data transmission
- User consent for any optional data collection
- Transparent data handling policies and procedures

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

**Security Middleware**
```javascript
// Example: Security middleware implementation
class SecurityMiddleware {
    constructor(config) {
        this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(config.rateLimits);
        this.pathValidator = new PathValidator(config.allowedPaths);
        this.contentScanner = new ContentScanner(config.scanRules);
    }
    
    async processFile(filePath, content) {
        // Rate limiting
        await this.rateLimiter.checkLimit(filePath);
        
        // Path validation
        this.pathValidator.validate(filePath);
        
        // Content security scanning
        const scanResult = await this.contentScanner.scan(content);
        if (scanResult.threats.length > 0) {
            throw new SecurityError('Malicious content detected');
        }
        
        return { validated: true, timestamp: Date.now() };
    }
}
```

**Threat Detection**
- Real-time malicious pattern detection
